let: Allows reassignment of the variable after its declaration but is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is defined.
const: Does not allow reassignment of the variable after its declaration and is also block-scoped. However, if the variable is an object or array, its properties or elements can be modified.

{
  let x = 10;
  const y = 20;

  x = 15; // Allowed
  y = 25; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

  console.log(x, y); // Outputs: 15, 20
}
