Q: Create a promise that resolves after 2 seconds with the message "Promise resolved!". Log the message to the console when it resolves.

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved!");
  }, 2000);
});

myPromise.then((message) => {
  console.log(message); 
});
